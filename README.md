# Project Name
CarNFT

## Project Description
CarNFT is a Web3-based project that aims to tokenize vehicles through the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each vehicle will be represented by 10 tokens that users can acquire, becoming co-owners of the vehicle. The vehicle will generate income through platforms like Uber, and the monthly profits will be automatically distributed to token holders through a smart contract dedicated to profit distribution.

## Project Justification
The rise of decentralized platforms and the sharing economy has opened up new opportunities for investment and participation in traditional assets. CarNFT offers an innovative solution for individuals to invest in productive vehicles without the need to own the entire asset. Through tokenization, the project enables participants to become co-owners of a vehicle that generates passive income, with the transparency and security provided by smart contracts on the blockchain. Additionally, the project seeks to democratize investment, allowing fractional participation and providing an efficient way to distribute income to investors.

## General Objective
Develop a Web3 platform that allows for the tokenization of productive vehicles and the automatic distribution of generated income to token owners through smart contracts.

## Specific Objectives
- Design and deploy a smart contract that represents the fractional ownership of a vehicle through 10 tokens, ensuring the transparency and security of transactions.
- Develop a second smart contract responsible for managing and proportionally distributing the profits generated by the vehicle to token owners.
- Integrate the platform with a blockchain network that facilitates the execution of smart contracts and allows users to interact with tokens and view profits transparently.
- Promote the adoption of the CarNFT project through marketing strategies aimed at users interested in decentralized investments and the sharing economy.
- Establish accountability and transparency mechanisms, providing investors with periodic reports on the vehicle's status, generated profits, and fund distributions.
